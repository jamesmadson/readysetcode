    <p class="intro"><strong>The Greater Flagstaff Chamber launched a city-wide digital initiative called READY.SET(){CODE}.
       Our mission is to raise awareness among Flagstaff youth to the language of coding and how its relevance transfers across
        all disciplines. Our free programs include-- FLG Code Camp, FLG Code Clubs, and Hack the Class- Intro to Coding.</p></strong>

              <p class="aligned-text">FLG Code Camp(s) run throughout the summer (each camp lasts one full week). Students learn the basics of coding through an
               interface that resembles one of a video game thereby building immediate enthusiasm. As the camp progresses, they work in
               groups to design computer games. The kids also listen to community leaders who are involved in tech related fields. </p>
            <p class="aligned-text">  Intro to Coding is a program hosted by a school's math or science teacher, operating with a similar but
              streamlined curriculum to the summer code camp. It runs roughly one hour a day and "takes over" the math or science period.
              Appropriate for ages 9-17 years old.</p>

    <p class="aligned-text">Through our Chamber’s sector strategy sessions, an educated workforce with technology skills has been identified as a top
     priority for many different types of local businesses. These include manufacturing, biotech, healthcare, finance and communications.
     READY.SET(){CODE} is an accessible avenue for local youth at early ages (9-17) to build a strong talent pipeline to supply local employers
      who state that their current and future success is reliant on tech-savvy talent with critical thinking and problem solving skills. Computer
      programming jobs are growing at 2X the national average,” according to Code.org. This equates to 1,000,000 more jobs than students by 2020
       and a $500 billion opportunity across every area of interest and industry. Coding is the universal skill/language of tomorrow’s workforce.
       Serving as a “catalyst for community and economic development” includes laying the foundation for building a highly skilled and employable
        local workforce for tomorrow.</p>

    <p class="dividing-only">We are aiming to inspire the younger generation to get started in understanding the language of technology and its cross-functionality
    in business. READY.SET(){CODE} is not just about programming but fostering the fundamentals of logic and becoming better equipped to
     function in the digitally advanced world we live in. In the process of learning to code, kids are learning mathematical and
     computational ideas like variables and conditionals. They are truly learning strategies for solving problems, designing projects,
      communication, and teamwork—all skills businesses look for when hiring. These basic to advanced skills being taught and interactions
      with the professional community will ultimately lead to a strong, confident new generation entering the increasingly growing
      digital workforce.</p>

    <p class="intro">The Chamber is impacting future curriculum choices which include coding in our local schools. So far, our efforts have
    ignited parental, business and education partners resulting in the offering of coding classes to their fall curriculum.
    In the end, our vision is to raise the national profile of Flagstaff as a digital and innovation hub.</p>
