      <h2>FLAGSTAFF CHAMBER DIGITAL INITIATIVE</h2>
    </header>
    <h1>Introduce ALL Flagstaff kids to computer programming.</h1>

    <p>An independent, non-profit organization supported by its members through donations, membership dues, and fundraising events to promote business & advocate on their behalf.</p>

    We are not a government agency or part of the City of Flagstaff, though we work closely together.

    The Chamber is more than 120 years old, having been founded in 1891 as the Board of Trade. It formally incorporated as an official Chamber of Commerce in 1949.

    A community problem solver, that promotes Flagstaff community and its total economy. The Chamber knows that a great climate for businesses and organizations is not automatic and that their interests must be encouraged, promoted and sometimes.

    More than 1,000 members strong. The vast majority of our members are small businesses employing fewer than 10 people.
