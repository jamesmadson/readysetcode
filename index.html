    <h1>Introduce ALL Flagstaff kids to computer programming!</h1>

    <p>An independent, non-profit organization supported by its members through donations, membership dues, and fundraising events to promote business & advocate on their behalf.</p>

    <p>A community problem solver, that promotes Flagstaff community and its total economy. The Chamber knows that a great climate for businesses and organizations is not automatic and that their interests must be encouraged, promoted and sometimes.</p>
